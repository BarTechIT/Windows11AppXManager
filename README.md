  <h1>What is Windows11AppXManager?</h1>

 <b>Windows11AppXManager</b> is a <b>lightweight and secure AppX management tool</b> for <b>Windows 11</b> that allows you to safely remove <b>UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps</b> and unwanted system bloatware. It leverages native <b>PowerShell commands</b>, particularly Get-AppxPackage, to list and uninstall installed AppX packages.
 
</div>

‚úÖ Why Use Get-AppxPackage in Windows 11?

One of the tool‚Äôs core functions is integration with the command:

Get-AppxPackage

This enables you to:

    View all installed AppX packages in Windows 11

    Filter by app name, publisher, or type

    Remove built-in or preinstalled bloatware

    Create a system restore point before any changes

    Use it without installation ‚Äì fully portable

Using Get-AppxPackage along with Windows11AppXManager gives you fine-grained control over AppX application management in Windows 11.
