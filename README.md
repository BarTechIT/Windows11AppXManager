  <h1>What is Windows11AppXManager?</h1>

 <b>Windows11AppXManager</b> is a <b>lightweight and secure AppX management tool</b> for <b>Windows 11</b> that allows you to safely remove <b>UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps</b> and unwanted system bloatware. It leverages native <b>PowerShell commands</b>, particularly Get-AppxPackage, to list and uninstall installed AppX packages.
